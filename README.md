# Screenguessr

## Introduction
This is a simple game in the style of [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), but using static images instead of Google Street View.

The project consists of an Angular frontend and a Nest.JS backend. The projects are maintained with Nx.

(It was made in a single day, so don't expect too much.)

## Examples:
This is an example of an image from the game:
